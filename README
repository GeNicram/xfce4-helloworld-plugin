This is simple template for writing xfce4 panel plugins using GTK3 and cmake.
Most of this code is taken from xfce-whiskermenu.
I think it will be very useful for me later. I would like to not lost it, so I
uploaded it to github :).


For xubuntu users below info might be useful:

xubuntu plugin location:
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xfce4/panel/plugins

Location for *.desktop file:
/usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins/
